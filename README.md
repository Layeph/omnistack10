# omnistack10
My attempt at week 10 of Omnistack
\nThis is an attempt at the 10th Omnistack week, a coding guide/class/course from rocketseat (in portuguese).
\nIn this project the main objective is to create a "Codeing Tinder" to meet new coders.
\nThe main things to learn were JavaScript, React, ReactNative, & NodeJS.
